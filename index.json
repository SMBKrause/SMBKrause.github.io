Better management of agrobiodiversity will likely play a critical role in transitioning toward more sustainable practices. In particular, innovation and developments targeting the aboveground and belowground components of agroecosystems should be informed by frameworks and approaches that harness the—in particular functional—diversity of complex microbial communities. Here, we review and discuss microbial trait-based approaches that will help us understand and steer agroecosystem functioning in the face of global change. We highlight how trait-based approaches can improve agricultural practices related to soil functioning (e.g., soil fertility and aggregation); climate regulation (e.g., carbon storage and greenhouse gas emissions) and adaptation to climate change; plant health; and reduction of contaminant-related hazards for human health. We also consider how microbial trait-based approaches can be used as a tool to improve cultivated plant performance through artificial selection and microbiome engineering. Last, we discuss the inherent obstacles associated with the development and implementation of trait-based approaches owing to strong interactions within microbial communities and linkages between plants and the soil environment. Despite these obstacles, microbial trait-based approaches hold promise for the sustainable management of agricultural ecosystems needed to feed and nourish a rapidly growing human population. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","tags":[],"title":"Microbial trait-based approaches for agroecosystems","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Sascha M.B.

Deterministic and stochastic processes are expected to contribute to microbial community assembly during long-term ecosystem recovery. We characterized soil prokaryotic and fungal communities, to determine their assembly patterns, along two chronosequences with early to later successional subtropical forests. Prokaryotic and fungal community composition was more variable in early successional forests but converged in the later successional forests. The community composition was governed by deterministic processes in the early stages, while the relative influence of stochasticity increased in the later stages. Environmental factors that predicted the shift in deterministic and stochastic balance varied within and across successional stages. In particular, the compositional dissimilarity of plant communities strongly predicted the relative influences of the two processes during succession. These findings suggest that the relative influences of deterministic and stochastic processes in shaping microbial community assembly shift during secondary succession.

Peat mining adversely affects methanotrophs, but activity and community composition/abundances may recover after restoration. Considering that the methanotrophic activity and growth are significantly stimulated in the presence of other microorganisms, the methane-driven interaction network, which encompasses methanotrophs and nonmethanotrophs (i.e., the methanotrophic interactome), may also be relevant in conferring community resilience. Yet, little is known of the methanotrophic interactome's response to and recovery from disturbances. Here, we determined the recovery of the methanotrophic interactome as inferred by a co-occurrence network analysis comparing pristine and restored peatlands. We coupled a DNA-based stable isotope probing (SIP) approach using [13C]CH4 to a co-occurrence network analysis derived from the 13C-enriched 16S rRNA gene sequences to relate the response in methanotrophic activity to the structuring of the interaction network. Methanotrophic activity and abundances recovered after peat restoration since 2000. “Methylomonaceae” taxa were the predominantly active methanotrophs in both peatlands, but the peatlands differed in the relative abundances of Methylacidiphilaceae and Methylocystis. However, bacterial community compositions were distinct in both peatlands. Likewise, the methanotrophic interactome was profoundly altered in the restored peatland. Structuring of the interaction network after peat mining resulted in the loss of complexity and modularity, indicating a less connected and efficient network, which may have consequences in the event of recurring/future disturbances. Therefore, determining the response of the methane-driven interaction network, in addition to relating methanotrophic activity to community composition/abundances, provided a more comprehensive understanding of the resilience of the methanotrophs. © 2021 American Society for Microbiology.

More importantly, a meta-analysis of the current literature on this topic revealed that there are virtually no data available in subtropical forests. To fill the abovementioned knowledge gap, we carried out a 3-year investigation of in situ CH4 efflux under drought in a subtropical forest, and found that drought significantly increased soil CH4 uptake (P \u003c 0.001). However, drought did not change oxidation potentials and abundances of methanotrophs, and similar methanotrophic communities were observed between the drought and ambient control sites based on metagenomic sequencing analysis. Active methanotrophic communities were dominated by the genus Methylosinus based on DNA stable-isotope probing analysis. Structural equation model analysis indicated that direct drought-derived pathway, i.e., increasing soil aerations, outweighs the indirect pathway, i.e., altering methanotrophic communities and activities, and plays a predominant role in driving soil CH4 uptake in forest ecosystems.

Before cultivation and marketing, the environmental risks of such modified varieties must be assessed. This includes an understanding of their effects on soil microorganisms and associated ecosystem services. This study analyzed the impact of a cisgenic modification of the potato variety Desirée to enhance resistance against the late blight-causing fungus Phytophthora infestans (Oomycetes) on the abundance and diversity of rhizosphere inhabiting microbial communities. Two experimental field sites in Ireland and the Netherlands were selected, and for 2 subsequent years, the cisgenic version of Desirée was compared in the presence and absence of fungicides to its non-engineered late blight-sensitive counterpart and a conventionally bred late blight-resistant variety. At the flowering stage, total DNA was extracted from the potato rhizosphere and subjected to PCR for quantifying and sequencing bacterial 16S rRNA genes, fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences, and nir genes encoding for bacterial nitrite reductases. Both bacterial and fungal communities responded to field conditions, potato varieties, year of cultivation, and bacteria sporadically also to fungicide treatments. At the Dutch site, without annual replication, fungicides stimulated nirK abundance for all potatoes, but with significance only for cisgenic Desirée. In all other cases, neither the abundance nor the diversity of any microbial marker differed between both Desirée versions. Overall, the study demonstrates environmental variation but also similar patterns of soil microbial diversity in potato rhizospheres and indicates that the cisgenic modification had no tangible impact on soil microbial communities. © Copyright © 2020 Krause, Näther, Ortiz Cortes, Mullins, Kessel, Lotz and Tebbe.","tags":[],"title":"No Tangible Effects of Field-Grown Cisgenic Potatoes on Soil Microbial Communities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.M.B.

However, the use of secondary treated wasterwater (TWW) could have consequences for the receiving soil environment and its resident microbial communities. The objective of this study was to characterize the importance of soil properties and habitats to the response of soil bacteria and archaea to irrigation with TWW. Two agricultural soils with contrasting textures (loamy sand or silt loam) and, for each, three variants differing in soil organic carbon and nitrogen, as generated by long-term fertilization, were analyzed. For each of these six soils, prokaryotic communities from two habitats, i.e., root-free bulk soil and the rhizosphere of developing cucumber plants in the greenhouse, were characterized. Communities were analyzed by the quantity and diversity of their polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified 16S rRNA genes. To account for TWW-associated nutrient effects, potable water (PW) served as a control. Amplicon sequence analysis showed that prokaryotic communities mainly consisted of bacteria (99.8%). Upon irrigation, regardless of the water quality, prokaryotic diversity declined, pH increased, and no bacterial growth was detected in bulk soil. In contrast, the growth of cucumbers was stimulated by TWW, indicating that plants were the main beneficiaries. Moreover, strong responses were seen in the rhizosphere, suggesting an indirect effect of TWW by altered rhizodepositions. The main bacterial responders to TWW were Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Planctomycetes. Changes in bacterial communities due to TWW were less pronounced in all variants of the silt loam, indicating the importance of clay and soil organic carbon for buffering effects of TWW on soil bacterial communities. Hence, soil organic carbon and soil texture are important parameters that need to be considered when applying TWW in agriculture. © 2020 Soil Science Society of China","tags":[],"title":"Soil properties and habitats determine the response of bacterial communities to agricultural wastewater irrigation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Congratulations to Sascha M.B.

In this study, Dr. Krause examined community interactions between methane-consuming bacteria such as methanotrophs and other associated microbes. It appears that the methanotrophs receive signals from other bacteria in the community to convert some of the methane to methanol. The methanol serves as food for those non-consumers of methane. These results suggest certain microbial community partners can alter gene expression in other community members.

This group of bacteria has intensively been studied as a model microbial functional guild because there is a strong link between the consumption of methane and the composition of MB communities, facilitating the study of microbial ``behavior'' in the environment.

Novel environmental controlling factors have been revealed (e.g. rare earth metals) as well as novel organisms with as yet unknown traits for MB. The resistance and resilience of methane consumption and methane consuming communities have been shown to depend on specific community members. The current knowledge on environmental distribution and of MB has led to propose a life-history scheme, classifying MB communities on their collective traits rather than singly on their capacity the oxidise methane alone.","tags":[],"title":"Methanotroph Ecology, Environmental Distribution and Functioning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["X.

However, little is known about the effect of warming and degradation and their interactions on ecosystem functions like soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools and methane (CH 4 ) uptake in this region. Here, we selected a long-term simulated warming site in a Tibetan alpine meadow with different degradation levels. After 4 years of warming, we analyzed soil total C (TC) and total N (TN) contents, extractable organic C (EOC) and extractable organic N (EON) contents as well as methanotrophic activity, abundance and community structure. Soil EOC and EON contents were measured through hot water extraction, whereas methanotrophic activity was measured along a gradient of CH 4 concentrations in laboratory incubations. Michaelis–Menten kinetics analysis [maximal rate of velocity (V max ) and half-saturation constant (K m )] was used to quantify changes in methanotrophic activity among the treatments. Active methanotrophic communities in the natural soils were measured via DNA-based stable isotope probing (SIP). The results showed that warming significantly increased soil EON contents, whereas degradation significantly decreased soil TC and TN contents, and EOC and EON contents. Methanotrophic activity was significantly lower at different levels of degradation but no significant effects were observed under warming. Changes in soil methanotrophic abundance among the treatments followed the same trend, but warming and degradation had no interactive effects on methanotrophic activity and abundance. Active methanotrophic communities in the natural meadow soils were dominated by Methylosinus (a Type II methanotroph). In conclusion, our results indicate that soil C and N pools and CH 4 oxidation capability were influenced more strongly by degradation than warming. However, warming may have an additional effect on the stability of these important ecosystem processes, regardless of degradation in this region. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","tags":[],"title":"Soil extractable organic C and N contents, methanotrophic activity under warming and degradation in a Tibetan alpine meadow","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.M.B.

It has been suggested that the methanotroph sustains these nonmethanotrophs by cross-feeding, because subsequent products of the methane oxidation pathway, such as methanol, represent alternative carbon sources. We established cocultures in a microcosm model system to determine the mechanism and substrate that underlay the observed cross-feeding in the environment. Lanthanum, a rare earth element, was applied because of its increasing importance in methylotrophy. We used co-occurring strains isolated from Lake Washington sediment that are involved in methane utilization: a methanotroph and two nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs. Gene-expression profiles and mutant analyses suggest that methanol is the dominant carbon and energy source the methanotroph provides to support growth of the nonmethanotrophs. However, in the presence of the nonmethanotroph, gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH (XoxF)-type, to the calcium-dependent MDH (MxaF)-type. Correspondingly, methanol is released into the medium only when the methanotroph expresses the MxaF-type MDH. These results suggest a cross-feeding mechanism in which the nonmethanotrophic partner induces a change in expression of methanotrophMDHs, resulting in release of methanol for its growth. This partner-induced change in gene expression that benefits the partner is a paradigm for microbial interactions that cannot be observed in studies of pure cultures, underscoring the importance of synthetic microbial community approaches to understand environmental microbiomes.","tags":[],"title":"Lanthanide-dependent cross-feeding of methane-derived carbon is linked by microbial community interactions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Z.

We observe some common trends in community dynamics between the two types of communities, toward representation of specific functional guilds.

Desiccation-rewetting events alter the soil quality and nutrient concentrations which drive microbial-mediated processes, including methane oxidation, a key biogeochemical process catalyzed by methanotrophic bacteria. Although aerobic methanotrophs showed remarkable resilience to a suite of physical disturbances induced as a single event, their resilience to recurring disturbances is less known. Here, using a rice field soil in a microcosm study, we determined whether recurrence and frequency of desiccation-rewetting impose an accumulating effect on the methanotrophic activity. The response of key aerobic methanotroph subgroups (type Ia, Ib, and II) were monitored using qPCR assays, and was supported by a t-RFLP analysis. The methanotrophic activity was resilient to recurring desiccation-rewetting, but increasing the frequency of the disturbance by twofold significantly decreased methane uptake rate. Both the qPCR and t-RFLP analyses were congruent, showing the dominance of type Ia/Ib methanotrophs prior to disturbance, and after disturbance, the recovering community was predominantly comprised of type Ia (Methylobacter) methanotrophs. Both type Ib and type II (Methylosinus/Methylocystis) methanotrophs were adversely affected by the disturbance, but type II methanotrophs showed recovery over time, indicating relatively higher resilience to the disturbance. This revealed distinct, yet unrecognized traits among the methanotroph community members. Our results show that recurring desiccation-rewetting before a recovery in community abundance had an accumulated effect, compromising methanotrophic activity.

The observed spatial patterns of CH4 consumption in drained peat meadows with and without short-term flooding highlighted the spatial complexity and responsiveness of the CH4 consuming zone upon environmental change.

This shift offers opportunities for a deeper mechanistic understanding of the role of biodiversity in maintaining multiple ecosystem processes and services. In this paper, we highlight studies that have focused on BEF of microbial communities with an emphasis on integrating trait-based approaches to microbial ecology. In doing so, we explore some of the inherent challenges and opportunities of understanding BEF using microbial systems. For example, microbial biologists characterize communities using gene phylogenies that are often unable to resolve functional traits. Additionally, experimental designs of existing microbial BEF studies are often inadequate to unravel BEF relationships. We argue that combining eco-physiological studies with contemporary molecular tools in a trait-based framework can reinforce our ability to link microbial diversity to ecosystem processes. We conclude that such trait-based approaches are a promising framework to increase the understanding of microbial BEF relationships and thus generating systematic principles in microbial ecology and more generally ecology. © 2014 Krause, Le Roux, Niklaus, Van Bodegom, Lennon, Bertilsson, Grossart, Philippot and Bodelier.","tags":[],"title":"Trait-based approaches for understanding microbial biodiversity and ecosystem functioning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

However, for microorganisms, this may not be true given that they display high physiological flexibility and have fast regeneration. This may result in fundamentally different patterns of resemblance, that is, in variable strength of phylogenetic signal. However, in microbiological inferences, trait similarities and therewith microbial interactions with its environment are mostly assumed to follow evolutionary relatedness. Here, we tested whether indeed a straightforward relationship between relatedness and physiological traits exists for aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB). We generated a comprehensive data set that included 30 MOB strains with quantitative physiological trait information. Phylogenetic trees were built from the 16S rRNA gene, a common phylogenetic marker, and the pmoA gene which encodes a subunit of the key enzyme involved in the first step of methane oxidation. We used a Blomberg's K from comparative biology to quantify the strength of phylogenetic signal of physiological traits. Phylogenetic signal was strongest for physiological traits associated with optimal growth pH and temperature indicating that adaptations to habitat are very strongly conserved in MOB. However, those physiological traits that are associated with kinetics of methane oxidation had only weak phylogenetic signals and were more pronounced with the pmoA than with the 16S rRNA gene phylogeny. In conclusion, our results give evidence that approaches based solely on taxonomical information will not yield further advancement on microbial eco-evolutionary interactions with its environment.

Here, we focus on the broad MOB subgroups (type I and type II MOB), and aim to conceptualize MOB functional traits and observational characteristics derived primarily from these environmental studies to be interpreted as microbial life strategies. We focus on the functional traits, and the conditions under which these traits will render different MOB subgroups a selective advantage. We hypothesize that type I and type II MOB generally have distinct life strategies, enabling them to predominate under different conditions and maintain functionality. The ecological characteristics implicated in their adopted life strategies are discussed, and incorporated into the Competitor-Stress tolerator-Ruderal functional classification framework as put forward for plant communities. In this context, type I MOB can broadly be classified as competitor-ruderal while type II MOB fit more within the stress tolerator categories.

We used soil from an Italian rice field in gradient microcosms, and analysed the response of methanotrophic communities to an NH 4 + pulse as a potential disturbance under two different CH 4 source strengths. We found a significant influence of source strength, i.e. the energy flow through the methanotrophic community, while NH 4 + had no effect. Our data suggest that historical contingencies, i.e. nitrogen fertilization, led to an ammonium-tolerant MOB community. Methanotrophs were able to oxidize virtually all CH 4 diffusing into the oxic-anoxic boundary layer regardless of NH 4 + addition. Total and active methanotrophic communities were assessed by a pmoA-specific microarray.

Using microcosms and cryosectioning, we sub-sampled the top 3-mm of a water-saturated soil at near in situ conditions in 100-μm steps. We assessed the community structure and activity using the particulate methane monooxygenase gene pmoA as a functional and phylogenetic marker by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-RFLP), a pmoA-specific diagnostic microarray, and cloning and sequencing. pmoA genes and transcripts were quantified using competitive reverse transcriptase PCR combined with t-RFLP. Only a subset of the methanotroph community was active. Oxygen microprofiles showed that 89% of total respiration was confined to a 0.67-mm-thick zone immediately above the oxic-anoxic interface, most probably driven by methane oxidation. In this zone, a Methylobacter-affiliated OTU was highly active with up to 18 pmoA transcripts per cell and seemed to be adapted to oxygen and methane concentrations in the micromolar range. Analysis of transcripts with a pmoA-specific microarray found a Methylosarcina-affiliated OTU associated with the surface zone.

Geostatistical methods were applied to visualize the spatial distribution of both groups. Spatial distribution as well as abundance of Ga-FeOB and MOB was clearly correlated to the hydrological gradient as expressed in moisture content of the soil. Ga-FeOB outnumbered the MOB subgroups suggesting their competitiveness or the prevalence of Fe2+ over CH4 oxidation in this floodplain. © 2012 Wang, Krause, Muyzer, Meima-Franke, Laanbroek and Bodelier.","tags":[],"title":"Spatial patterns of iron- and methane-oxidizing bacterial communities in an irregularly flooded, riparian wetland","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

In this article we investigate the succession of methanotrophs in oxygen-methane counter-gradients. We used a gradient microcosm system that simulates oxic-anoxic interfaces of a water-saturated paddy soils, and measured pmoA-based (gene encoding particulate methane monooxygenase) terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) profiles at both the transcription (mRNA) and the population (DNA) levels. The DNA T-RFLP profiles indicated that the methanotrophic community present clearly differed from the active methanotrophic community. We observed a succession of the methanotrophic community over time without any direct effect of pore water chemistry on the community structure. Both the total population and the active subpopulation changed with time, whereas methane oxidation rates remained nearly constant. Hence, we suggest that a diverse microbial seed bank of methanotrophs is important in maintaining the function in a dynamic ecosystem. © 2010 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.","tags":[],"title":"Succession of methanotrophs in oxygen-methane counter-gradients of flooded rice paddies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

These patterns, however, have strong influences on the interpretations made from analysing microbial processes and community structure. Here we report the first use of geostatistics to analyse the spatial heterogeneity of methanotrophs in a rice field soil (Vercelli, Italy). We used the gene encoding the particulate methane monooxygenase, pmoA, for terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis. The profiles obtained were compared using a pseudo-variogram analysis to study autocorrelation as a function of distance. We demonstrated that there was no large-scale spatial structure at this study site, but a micro-scale spatial structure could not be excluded. A species accumulation curve with all terminal restriction fragments revealed that even 75 samples were insufficient to cover the diversity of methanotrophs in a rice field. However, a species accumulation curve of methanotrophs defined as operational taxonomic units validated from a clone library with 90% coverage demonstrated saturation after approximately 15 samples. The results of this study have consequences for studying the diversity and function of methanotrophs. In this agroecosystem population structure showed no spatial pattern implying that both a systematic and random sampling design would be adequate. © 2009 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","tags":[],"title":"Spatial heterogeneity of methanotrophs: A geostatistical analysis of pmoA-based T-RFLP patterns in a paddy soil","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

However, the ultimate causes for this intersexual niche segregation remain poorly understood. It has been suggested that sexual dimorphism is a consequence of dimorphic niches based upon different reproductive costs and activities of the sexes. Here we provide evidence from field data to examine this hypothesis by studying the behavioral background of niche segregation in Tetrix ceperoi. Our data revealed distinct sexual differences in the substrates on which the insects perched and in the solar radiation of these locations. Males were found at brighter locations and more often on bare ground than females. Incorporation of behavioral data in our analysis showed that patches of bare ground were mainly utilized during mating behavior, in which males invested more time than females. In contrast, females spent more time resting and feeding in the vegetation. Intersexual differences in the proportion of autotomized individuals indicate that males might suffer higher predation risks. These patterns support the dimorphic niches hypothesis, which suggests that differential habitat utilization is caused by differences in the life history strategies of males and females, since males should accept a higher predation risk due to the benefits of multiple matings. Females should invest more time in gaining nutrients and energy for egg production and survival, whereas males should spend more time with searching for mates. We suggest that behavioral covariates should more often be implemented in ecological analyses, since these might have a strong explanatory power. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","tags":[],"title":"Intersexual niche segregation in Cepero's Ground-hopper, Tetrix ceperoi","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://SMBKrause.github.io/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://SMBKrause.github.io/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f1d044c0738ab9f19347f15c290a71a1","permalink":"https://SMBKrause.github.io/research/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Research","type":"widget_page"}]
